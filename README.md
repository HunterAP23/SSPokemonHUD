SSPokemonHUD
------------

SSPokemonHUD is an idea that [ShockSlayer](https://www.youtube.com/c/shockslayer "SS's YouTube Channel") had come up with and was starting to work on for his [Twitch streams](https://twitch.tv/shockslayer "SS's Twitch").

You will need to host this on web server of some sort.

* On Windows I'd recommend [WAMP](http://www.wampserver.com/en/) (mainly because I couldn't ever get XAMPP to work...).
* Under Linux I'd suggest Apache.

Make a copy of `team.example.json` and name it `team.json` to get started.

Resources you will need to download:
* [Assets Pack](http://www.mediafire.com/download/1m8bm8mj8z1ozrd/SSPokemonHUD-assets.zip) ([backup link](https://mega.nz/#!MddziApS!lGOZm1ZIleFFByirBnQtEqmt_86lbQvBG1kAjLWdxJQ)) - put in the /assets folder
* [Pokemon GB Fonts](http://www.fontspace.com/jackster-productions/pokemon-gb) - put in the /fonts folder
